# declare variable n with value 10


# declare max value with 100


# declare data var using random module with 1 and max value. Run for loop against n value


# Sort the numbers in data var

# Print sorted data

# Let user to enter the target value


# Declare target position using binary search function with the two parameters data and target

# if target position is equal to -1

    # Print out a message your taget value is not in the list

# else

    # Print out a message "your target value is at index" , call the target position variable
